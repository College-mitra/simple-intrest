# Simple Interest Calculator

This project is a simple interest calculator that helps users calculate the simple interest based on the principal amount, rate of interest, and time period.

## 📌 Formula Used

Simple Interest (SI) is calculated using the formula:

SI = (P × R × T) / 100

Where:
- P = Principal amount
- R = Rate of interest (per year)
- T = Time (in years)

## 🛠 How It Works

1. Enter the principal amount.
2. Enter the rate of interest.
3. Enter the time period in years.
4. The calculator computes the simple interest using the formula.
